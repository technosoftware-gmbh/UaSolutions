# Technosoftware GmbH OPC UA Solutions .NET

## Overview

The OPC UA Solutions .NET are based on the OPC Foundation stack with several enhancements to make the development smooth and efficient. While we use these solutions mainly in our own services it is also possible to use it in your own development. 

Develop OPC UA compliant Clients and Servers with C# targeting .NET 10.0, .NET 9.0 and .NET 8.0. For backward compatibility we also provide .NET 4.8 and .NET 4.7.2 support.

.NET 10.0, .NET 9.0 and .NET 8.0 allows you develop applications that run on all common platforms available today, including Linux, macOS and Windows 11/10 (including embedded/IoT editions) without requiring platform-specific modifications.

## Product Lifecycle

Version 4 is the mainline version.

Version 3.4 entered the long term support phase on 12-SEP-2025. Therefore all versions before are End of Life (EOL).

### Mainline Version (ML)

The Mainline is the most current version of a product. It’s the version we actively develop, enhance, and maintain. All new features, improvements, and components are added here. As a new customer, you’ll always receive the latest mainline version. The support subscription always includes the latest mainline version.

### Long Term Support (LTS)

When a new mainline release comes out, the version just before it enters Long Term Support (LTS). For example, if version 4.0.0 is released, the 4.0.x series becomes the mainline, while the latest 3.x.x moves into LTS.

During the LTS phase:

 * No new features are added
 * Bug fixes are provided if needed
 * The standard LTS period lasts one year (365 days) starting from the release of the next mainline version
	
This gives customers with a valid support subscription at least one year of transition time to update your application.

Customers with a valid support subscription at the time a version enters the LTS phase can request support and/or bug fixes for the LTS version. All other customers needs to upgrade to the ML version first. New purchases of a support subscription are always for the ML version.

### End of Life (EOL)

When a product’s LTS period ends, it enters End of Life (EOL). From that point on, no further updates, fixes, or support are provided.

If your application relies on a version that is nearing EOL, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest mainline release. If upgrading is not possible, you may request a quote for the source code edition of the solution, which allows you to maintain and fix it yourself.
