# Technosoftware GmbH OPC UA Solutions .NET

## Overview

The OPC UA Solutions .NET are based on the OPC Foundation stack with several enhancements to make the development smooth and efficient. While we use these solutions mainly in our own services it is also possible to use it in your own development. 

Develop OPC UA compliant Clients and Servers with C# targeting .NET 10.0, .NET 9.0 and .NET 8.0. For backward compatibility we also provide .NET 4.8 and .NET 4.7.2 support.

.NET 10.0, .NET 9.0 and .NET 8.0 allows you develop applications that run on all common platforms available today, including Linux, macOS and Windows 11/10 (including embedded/IoT editions) without requiring platform-specific modifications.
